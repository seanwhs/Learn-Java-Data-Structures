# Java Data Structures Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey for data structures in Java.
Java code examples and explanations are provided for various data structures. 

## Table of Contents

- [Arrays](#arrays)
- [List](#list)
- [Set](#set)
- [Map](#map)

## Arrays

The `Arrays` section covers fundamental operations and concepts related to arrays in Java. It includes examples of array initialization, accessing elements, updating values, and more.

**[Link to Arrays Documentation](arrays/README.md)**

## List

The `List` section provides code examples and explanations for Java List implementations such as ArrayList and LinkedList. Learn about adding, removing, and accessing elements in a list.

**[Link to List Documentation](list/README.md)**

## Set

Explore Java Set implementations like HashSet and TreeSet in the `Set` section. Understand the unique characteristics of sets and how to perform set operations.

**[Link to Set Documentation](set/README.md)**

## Map

In the `Map` section, discover Java Map implementations like HashMap and TreeMap. Learn how to work with key-value pairs, iterate through maps, and perform common map operations.
